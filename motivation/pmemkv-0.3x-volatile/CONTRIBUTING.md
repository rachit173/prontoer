Creating New Engines
--------------------

There are several motivations to create a `pmemkv` storage engine:

* Using a completely different implementation strategy than already exists
* Trying out a signifcant change to an existing engine without disruption
* Sharing an experimental engine that isn't even finished yet

Next we'll walk you through the steps of creating a new engine.

### Picking Engine Name

* Relatively short (users will have to type this!)
* Formatted in all lower-case
* No whitespace or special characters
* For this example: `mytree`

### Creating Engine Header

* Create `src/engines/mytree.h` header file
* For new engines, use `blackhole.h` as a template
* Use `pmemkv::mytree` namespace to define internal types
* Define `ENGINE` constant in namespace to export engine name
* Use camel-case for implementation class name (`class MyTree`)

### Creating Engine Implementation

* Create `src/engines/mytree.cc` implementation file
* For new engines, use `blackhole.cc` as a template
* Use `pmemkv::mytree` namespace defined by the header

### Providing Unit Test

* Create `tests/engines/mytree_test.cc` for unit tests
* For new engines, use `blackhole_test.cc` as a template
* For stable engines, just copy existing tests (eventually replace the original)

### Updating Build System

* In `CMakeLists.txt`:
    * Add `src/engines/mytree.h` and `src/engines/mytree.cc` to `SOURCE_FILES`
    * Add `tests/mytree_test.cc` to `pmemkv_test` executable
    * Use `pkg_check_modules` and/or `find_package` for upstream libraries
* `make` should now run to completion without errors

### Updating KVEngine

* In `src/pmemkv.cc`:
    * Add `#include "engines/mytree.h"`
    * Update `KVEngine::Open` to return new `MyTree` instances
    * Update `KVEngine::Close` to delete `MyTree` instances
* Engine should now work with `pmemkv_bench` and high-level bindings

### Documentation

* In `ENGINES.md`, add `mytree` section
* In `README.md`, link `mytree` in the table of supported engines
* Submit blog post on pmem.io
